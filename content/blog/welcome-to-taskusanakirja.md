The word _taskusanakirja_ exemplifies the elegant compound nature of Finnish vocabulary. Breaking it down: _tasku_ (pocket) + _sanakirja_ (dictionary), it literally translates to "pocket dictionary" - a fitting name for a tool designed to be as quick and accessible as reaching into one's coat.

## The Components

**Tasku** derives from the Proto-Finnic \*tasku, likely borrowed from an early Germanic source (compare Swedish \*taska\*, "bag"). The semantic shift from "bag" to "pocket" reflects the evolution of clothing technology itself.

**Sanakirja** is itself a compound: _sana_ (word) + _kirja_ (book). The word _sana_ has ancient Uralic roots, while the Proto-Finnic \*kirja is more mysterious. The original sense was a decoration or carved or embroidered pattern, but its secondary sense of writing seems to develop after the introduction of literacy to Finnic speakers.

## Digital Pockets

In creating a featherweight command-line based dictionary (the whole thing is under 70 megabytes!), we've reimagined what a "pocket" means in the digital age. Your own laptop's hard drive is your pocket - immediate, accessible, always at hand. Tools for language learning have always held portability and accessibility at a premium, from leather-bound pocket editions to what we have here, in your humble terminal emulator.

This intersection of historical linguistics and modern technology captures what Taskusanakirja aims to be: a bridge between the scholarly tradition of lexicography and the practical needs of contemporary language learners.
