The word *taskusanakirja* exemplifies the elegant compound nature of Finnish vocabulary. Breaking it down: *tasku* (pocket) + *sanakirja* (dictionary), it literally translates to "pocket dictionary"—a fitting name for a tool designed to be as accessible as reaching into one's coat.

## The Components

**Tasku** derives from the Proto-Finnic *tasku, likely borrowed from an early Germanic source (compare Swedish *taska*, "bag"). The semantic shift from "bag" to "pocket" reflects the evolution of clothing technology itself.

**Sanakirja** is itself a compound: *sana* (word) + *kirja* (book). The word *sana* has ancient Uralic roots, while *kirja* entered Finnish through Old Church Slavonic, ultimately from Greek *graphein* (to write).

## Digital Pockets

In creating a command-line dictionary, we've reimagined what a "pocket" means in the digital age. Your terminal becomes the pocket—always accessible, always at hand. The etymology reminds us that tools for language learning have always been about portability and accessibility, from leather-bound pocket editions to terminal emulators.

This intersection of historical linguistics and modern technology captures what Taskusanakirja aims to be: a bridge between the scholarly tradition of lexicography and the practical needs of contemporary language learners.
