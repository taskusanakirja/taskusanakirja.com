# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** August 16, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Taskusanakirja software, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using Taskusanakirja, you agree to be bound by these Terms and the End User License Agreement (EULA). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

- **Free Edition:** Includes core dictionary functionality for personal, non-commercial use.
  - Interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) for dictionary browsing.
  - Command-line word lookup (`find`).
  - Reverse English-to-Finnish definition search (`rfind`).
  - A local web server for browser-based use (`serve`).
- **Pro Edition:** Unlocked via a purchased license key, this edition includes all Free features plus advanced linguistic capabilities.
  - Complete lemmatization to find the base form (lemma) of any inflected Finnish word (`lemma` command).
  - Access to download the separate inflections database, which is required for lemmatization.

## 3. User Accounts and License Keys

### 3.1 Pro License Purchase

- Pro licenses are purchased through our website via our authorized third-party reseller, Gumroad.
- License keys are delivered electronically after payment confirmation.
- Please see Section 8 for our Refund Policy.

### 3.2 License Key Responsibility

- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your license key. We are not liable for unauthorized use of your license key.
- Your Pro license key is for your use only and is limited to one device at a time.
  - A 'device' is defined by the unique machine identifier. Please be aware that significant hardware changes or operating system reinstalls may alter this identifier, requiring you to contact support to transfer your license to the 'new' device.
- To enforce this, the license is validated against a unique, one-way cryptographic hash of a machine identifier. This secure hash is the only identifier transmitted to our servers and is not reversible.
- Lost license keys may be recovered by contacting support with proof of purchase. To transfer a license to a new device, you must contact `support@taskusanakirja.com` and provide your original license key for verification.

## 4. Acceptable Use

### 4.1 Permitted Use

You may use Taskusanakirja for personal, educational, and professional purposes, subject to the license restrictions outlined in the EULA.

### 4.2 Prohibited Use

You may not:

- Share, distribute, or resell your Pro license key.
- Use the Service for any illegal activities.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to circumvent technical measures such as code obfuscation.
- Use automated systems to overwhelm our web or license validation services.
- Sublicense, rent, or lease the Software.

## 5. Content and Accuracy

### 5.1 Dictionary Content

- Dictionary data is aggregated from third-party sources, primarily Wiktionary and Tatoeba, and is provided for linguistic reference purposes.
- We strive for accuracy but do not guarantee that the content is complete, accurate, or suitable for any specific purpose.
- We do not warrant that the Pro Edition's inflection search will find the base form for every possible inflected Finnish word.

## 6. Intellectual Property

### 6.1 Our Property

The Service, including its software, source code, databases, user interface designs, and documentation, is our intellectual property or that of our licensors and is protected by copyright law.

### 6.2 Feedback

Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you provide may be used by us without compensation or attribution.

## 7. Privacy

Your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy, available at `https://taskusanakirja.com/privacy-policy`.

### 7.1 Data Collection

- The desktop application is designed to work offline. All dictionary lookups and searches are processed locally on your device.
- An internet connection is required for two specific functions:
  1. **License Validation:** Your Pro license key and the one-way hashed machine identifier are sent to our servers for initial activation and periodic validation.
  2. **Data Downloads:** Pro users must connect to our servers to download the inflections database.

## 8. Payment Terms

### 8.1 Pricing and License Model

- A Pro license is a one-time purchase for the current major version of the Software (e.g., v1.x.x). The current version of the software is v1.0.0.
- Your license is perpetual for the major version it was purchased for and entitles you to all minor and patch updates within that version series.
- We reserve the right to charge for major version upgrades (e.g., from v1.x.x to v2.x.x), which may require a new license purchase.
- Prices are displayed on our website and may change, but changes will not affect existing licenses. Prices may also be reflected in the app version itself, but these are not necessarily the most up to date prices.

### 8.2 Refunds

- You may request a refund within fourteen (14) days of your purchase date, subject to the policies of our reseller, Gumroad.
- **Eligibility Exclusion:** To be eligible for a refund, you must not have initiated a download of the separate inflections database. Due to its digital nature, the purchase is considered final and non-refundable once the database download has commenced.
- To request a refund, please contact `support@taskusanakirja.com` with your full license key and proof of purchase.

### 8.3 Taxes

Our authorized reseller, Gumroad, acts as the Merchant of Record for all Pro license purchases. The price shown on the purchase page is the final price you will pay. It includes any applicable sales taxes or Value Added Tax (VAT) required by your jurisdiction. Gumroad is responsible for calculating, collecting, and remitting these taxes to the relevant tax authorities.

## 9. Service Availability

### 9.1 Availability

- The core desktop application functions offline once installed and data is downloaded.
- Server-dependent features, such as initial license activation and validation, are provided on an "as-available" basis and are not guaranteed to be available indefinitely.
  - However, a successfully activated Pro license will continue to function offline for an extended period of up to 30 days as described in our documentation.

### 9.2 Modifications

We may update, modify, or discontinue features of the Service with reasonable notice.
