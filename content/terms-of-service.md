# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** August 16, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Taskusanakirja software, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using Taskusanakirja, you agree to be bound by these Terms and the End User License Agreement (EULA). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Taskusanakirja provides a Finnish-English dictionary application with the following editions and features:

- **Free Edition:** Includes core dictionary functionality for personal, non-commercial use.
  - Interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI) for dictionary browsing.
  - Command-line word lookup (`find`).
  - Reverse English-to-Finnish definition search (`rfind`).
  - A local web server for browser-based use (`serve`).
- **Pro Edition:** Unlocked via a purchased license key, this edition includes all Free features plus advanced linguistic capabilities.
  - Complete lemmatization to find the base form (lemma) of any inflected Finnish word (`lemma` command).
  - Access to download the separate inflections database, which is required for lemmatization.
- **Documentation and support resources.**

## 3. User Accounts and License Keys

### 3.1 Pro License Purchase

- Pro licenses are purchased through our website via our authorized third-party reseller, Gumroad.
- License keys are delivered electronically after payment confirmation.
- Please see Section 8 for our Refund Policy.

### 3.2 License Key Responsibility and Transfer

- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your license key. We are not liable for unauthorized use of your license key.
- Your Pro license key is for your use only and is limited to one device at a time.
  - A 'device' is defined by the unique machine identifier. Please be aware that significant hardware changes or operating system reinstalls may alter this identifier, requiring you to contact us to transfer your license to the 'new' device.
- To enforce this, the license is validated against a unique, one-way cryptographic hash of a machine identifier. This secure hash is the only identifier transmitted to our servers and is not reversible.

**License Transfers:** If you need to transfer your Pro license to a new device (due to hardware changes, OS reinstalls, or device replacement), you must contact [andrew@siilikuin.com](mailto:andrew@siilikuin.com). **You will be required to provide your complete, original license key for verification.** For this process, we collect:

- Your complete, original license key for verification
- Communication records to document the transfer request
- The new device's hashed machine identifier when you reactivate

**Important:** We do not have a process for license recovery if you lose your license key completely. If you cannot provide your complete, original license key, we cannot assist with license transfers. Please keep your license key secure and backed up.

Upon successful verification of a transfer request, we will deactivate the license from the previously registered device. This will permit you to perform the activation process on a new machine using your existing key.

This information is used solely to verify your identity as the legitimate license holder and to maintain the integrity of our one-device-per-license policy. We retain records of license transfers for the duration of your license validity plus one year. For more information about data collection and retention during this process, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://taskusanakirja.com/privacy-policy).

## 4. Acceptable Use

### 4.1 Permitted Use

You may use Taskusanakirja for personal, and educational purposes, subject to the license restrictions outlined in the EULA. Commercial purposes require a separate agreement.

### 4.2 Prohibited Use

You may not:

- Share, distribute, or resell your Pro license key.
- Use the Service for any illegal activities.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to circumvent technical measures such as code obfuscation.
- Use automated systems to overwhelm our web or license validation services.
- Sublicense, rent, or lease the Software.

## 5. Content and Accuracy

### 5.1 Dictionary Content

- Dictionary data is aggregated from third-party sources, primarily Wiktionary and Tatoeba, and is provided for linguistic reference purposes.
- We strive for accuracy but do not guarantee that the content is complete, accurate, or suitable for any specific purpose.
- We do not warrant that the Pro Edition's inflection search will find the base form for every possible inflected Finnish word.

## 6. Intellectual Property

### 6.1 Our Property

The Service, including its software, source code, databases, user interface designs, and documentation, is our intellectual property or that of our licensors and is protected by copyright law.

### 6.2 Feedback

Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you provide may be used by us without compensation or attribution.

## 7. Privacy

Your use of the Service is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://taskusanakirja.com/privacy-policy).

For detailed information about how long we retain different types of data and our data breach notification procedures, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://taskusanakirja.com/privacy-policy).

### 7.1 Data Collection

- The desktop application is designed to work offline. All dictionary lookups and searches are processed locally on your device.
- An internet connection is required for two specific functions:
  1. **License Validation:** Your Pro license key and the one-way hashed machine identifier are sent to our servers for initial activation and periodic validation.
  2. **Data Downloads:** Pro users must connect to our servers to download the inflections database.

## 8. Communications

### 8.1 Email Collection and Use

We only collect email addresses through our third-party payment processor, Gumroad, when you purchase a Pro license. We use these email addresses to:

- Deliver your license key after purchase
- Provide customer support related to your license
- Send critical service updates that may affect your license functionality

### 8.2 Marketing Communications

We do not send promotional or marketing emails unless you explicitly opt in by contacting us directly at [andrew@siilikuin.com](mailto:andrew@siilikuin.com) and requesting to receive such communications.

### 8.3 Transactional Communications

Certain communications related to your use of the Service, including license delivery confirmations, support responses, and critical service announcements, are considered transactional and necessary for the operation of the Service. These communications are not promotional in nature.

## 9. Payment Terms

### 9.1 Pricing and License Model

- A Pro license is a one-time purchase for the current major version of the Software (e.g., v1.x.x). **Software Version:** v1.0.0
- Your license is perpetual for the major version it was purchased for and entitles you to all minor and patch updates within that version series.
- We reserve the right to charge for major version upgrades (e.g., from v1.x.x to v2.x.x), which may require a new license purchase.
- Prices are displayed on our website and may change, but changes will not affect existing licenses. Prices may also be reflected in the app version itself, but these are not necessarily the most up to date prices.

### 9.2 Refunds

Purchases of a Taskusanakirja Pro license are processed through our authorized third-party reseller, Gumroad. All refund requests are therefore also governed by Gumroad's own refund policies and terms of service.

Subject to the terms outlined herein and on the Gumroad platform, you may request a refund within fourteen (14) days of your purchase date.

#### 9.2.1 Eligibility

You may request a refund within fourteen (14) days of your purchase date. To process your refund, we will require proof of purchase and your complete license key.

#### 9.2.2 How to Request a Refund

All refunds are processed through Gumroad and are subject to their processing times and terms.

### 9.3 Taxes

Our authorized reseller, Gumroad, acts as the Merchant of Record for all Pro license purchases. The price shown on the purchase page is the final price you will pay. It includes any applicable sales taxes or Value Added Tax (VAT) required by your jurisdiction. Gumroad is responsible for calculating, collecting, and remitting these taxes to the relevant tax authorities.

## 10. Service Availability

### 10.1 Availability

- The core desktop application functions offline once installed and data is downloaded.
