  "Learn about the creator of Taskusanakirja and the motivation behind this
  Finnish-English dictionary tool."

My name is Andrew Quinn, and I'm a software consultant and Finnish language
learner living in Tampere, Finland.

I created **Taskusanakirja** because I wanted a dictionary that fit my workflow
as a developer. I spend all day in the terminal, and I wanted a tool that was as
fast and efficient as the other command-line utilities I rely on.

This project is part of my larger goal to build better software tools for
Finnish language learners. You can find more of my work at
[finbug.xyz](http://finbug.xyz/) and [siilikuin.com](https://siilikuin.com/).

Kiitos, kun kokeilit Taskusanakirjaa! (Thanks for trying Taskusanakirja!)
