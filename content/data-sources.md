## Data Sources

### Our Lexical Foundation: Wiktionary

Taskusanakirja's comprehensive Finnish-English dictionary is built upon data sourced from [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/), the collaborative multilingual dictionary project. According to [Wiktionary's own copyright policy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Copyrights), the original text of its entries is **dual-licensed** to the public under both the **[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)** and the **[GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html)**, Version 1.1 or any later version.

This dual-license framework ensures that the data will remain free forever and can be used by anyone, subject to the conditions of those licenses. As a user of Taskusanakirja's derived dictionary data, you must comply with the terms of *both* licenses, which primarily require that you attribute the source and share any derivative works under the same licenses.

### Example Sentences: Tatoeba

To provide real-world context, Taskusanakirja embeds example sentences sourced from the [Tatoeba project](https://tatoeba.org/), an open, collaborative database of sentences and translations.

**License for Sentences**  
The vast majority of textual sentences from Tatoeba are licensed under the **[Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 France (CC-BY 2.0 FR)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/fr/deed.en)** license.

This license grants you the freedom to:
- **Share:** Copy and redistribute the sentences.
- **Adapt:** Remix, transform, and build upon the sentences.
- **Use Commercially:** Use the sentences for any purpose, including commercial ones.

**Attribution for Sentences**  
The core requirement of the CC-BY license is **attribution**. When you use a sentence from Tatoeba, you must give appropriate credit by citing the original author of that sentence. Taskusanakirja provides this attribution for every example sentence displayed.

**Disclaimer**  
As stated in their [Terms of Use](https://tatoeba.org/eng/terms_of_use), Tatoeba is a community-driven project. The validity and accuracy of sentences and their translations are not guaranteed by any professional intervention. They are provided for linguistic utility and should be used with this understanding.

## Open Data Commitment & Commercial Use

The licenses for both Wiktionary and Tatoeba data permit commercial use. The "free" in their licenses refers to freedom, not price.

Therefore, while the data itself is licensed for free use, we may charge a fee for the service of accessing our processed, curated, and conveniently packaged datasets. This fee covers our development, hosting, and maintenance costs. Any data you purchase and download from us remains under its original open licenses, granting you all the freedoms that come with them.

## Contributing Back
