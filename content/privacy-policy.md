# TL;DR

Taskusanakirja is designed to protect your privacy. The Free Edition works completely offline and collects no data whatsoever. The Pro Edition only connects to the internet to validate your license, collecting just your license key and a hashed machine identifier for license enforcement - we never see your dictionary searches or usage patterns. We don't track you, sell your data, or share it with anyone except essential service providers like Gumroad for payment processing. All dictionary data and searches stay on your device. We don't use analytics in the app, send crash reports, or auto-update. You have full rights to access, correct, or delete any personal data we hold by contacting <andrew@siilikuin.com>. We're fully GDPR compliant with clear lawful bases for any data processing we do. For complete details, please read the full policy below.

# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 16, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Taskusanakirja ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our software, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). Your privacy is a core principle of our design.

## 1. Our Privacy Commitment

Taskusanakirja is built to be a private, offline-first tool. The core dictionary and search functionalities are processed entirely on your local device. We do not track your search queries or dictionary usage, and an internet connection is not required for the application's primary features.

## 2. What Information We Collect and Why

**Data Minimization Principle:** We are committed to data minimization - we only collect personal information that is necessary, relevant, and limited to what is needed for the purposes outlined in this policy. We do not collect information "just in case" it might be useful later.

We collect the minimum information necessary to provide and improve our Service. Collection practices differ between the application, our website, and the license purchase process.

### 2.1 The Taskusanakirja Application

- **Free Edition:** The Free Edition does not collect or transmit any personal information or usage data. All operations are performed locally on your device.

- **Pro Edition License Validation:** An internet connection is required for Pro license activation and periodic validation. During this process, we collect the following:
  - **Your Pro license key:** To verify that the license is valid.
  - **A one-way, cryptographically secure hash of a machine identifier:** This is used solely to enforce our one-device-per-license policy and is not reversible or tied to your personal identity. No other identifying information about your device is collected.

- **Pro Edition Data Downloads:** An internet connection is required to download the inflections database. We may log standard connection information (such as an IP address) to monitor for security and prevent abuse, but this data is not tied to your license key.

### 2.2 Purchasing a Pro License

Payment processing is handled by our authorized third-party reseller, **Gumroad**, which acts as the Merchant of Record.

We do not receive, process, or store your payment information, such as credit card details.

To deliver your license, Gumroad provides us with your email address, a transaction ID, and the purchase date.

### 2.3 Our Website (taskusanakirja.com)

When you visit our website, we may collect standard technical information to ensure its functionality and to improve our services:

- **Standard web logs:** This may include your IP address, browser type, referring pages, and timestamps.
- **Analytics data:** We use aggregated and anonymized usage data to understand website traffic patterns.
- **Cookies:** We use only essential cookies required for site functionality (such as maintaining your session). We do not use tracking, advertising, or third-party analytics cookies. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, though this may affect site functionality.

### 2.4 What We Don't Collect

To protect your privacy, Taskusanakirja does _not_:

- Automatically check for or install updates
- Collect crash reports or diagnostic data
- Track your dictionary searches or lookup history
- Monitor how you use the application
- Send any telemetry or usage analytics from the app

The application will only connect to the internet when you explicitly:

- Activate or validate your Pro license
- Download the inflections database (Pro Edition)"

### 2.5 License Transfer and Recovery

License Transfers: If you need to transfer your Pro license to a new device (due to hardware changes, OS reinstalls, or device replacement), you must contact <andrew@siilikuin.com>. For this process, we collect:

- Your complete original license key for verification
- Communication records to document the transfer request
- The new device's hashed machine identifier when you reactivate

License Recovery: If you've lost your license key, we can help recover it. For this process, we collect:

- Proof of purchase information (order number, email used for purchase, purchase date)
- Your email correspondence regarding the recovery request

This information is used solely to verify your identity as the legitimate license holder and to maintain the integrity of our one-device-per-license policy. We retain records of license transfers and recoveries for the duration of your license validity plus one year.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following specific purposes:

- **To Provide and Maintain the Service:**
  - Validate and activate your Pro license key.
  - Allow Pro users to download necessary databases.
  - Provide customer support and respond to your inquiries.
  - License transfer/recovery records: Retained for the duration of your license validity plus 1 year

- **For Communication:**
  - Send you your Pro license purchase confirmation via email.
  - Notify Pro license holders of critical software updates or service announcements.

- **To Improve Our Services:**
  - Analyze aggregated website traffic to improve user experience.
  - Diagnose and fix technical issues related to our website or license validation services.

### 3.1 Marketing and Promotional Communications

- We send transactional emails only (license delivery, critical updates affecting your service)
- We do not send promotional or marketing emails unless you explicitly opt in
- You may unsubscribe from non-essential communications at any time by contacting <andrew@siilikuin.com>

## 4. Information Sharing

We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not sell your personal information.
