# Prose-Invert Dark Mode Fix - Implementation Notes

## Current Status (2025-07-30)

Successfully implemented and validated prose-invert dark mode typography styles.
The fix is committed and the validation system is in place.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Tailwind Configuration Issue

**Problem**: The prose-invert styles were incorrectly defined as CSS variables
within the DEFAULT typography variant.

**Solution**: Moved all dark mode typography styles to a proper 'invert' variant
as required by @tailwindcss/typography plugin.

```javascript
// INCORRECT (what we had):
typography: {
  DEFAULT: {
    css: {
      '--tw-prose-invert-body': theme('colors.ochre.100'),
      // ... other CSS variables
    }
  }
}

// CORRECT (what we implemented):
typography: {
  DEFAULT: {
    // ... default styles
  },
  invert: {
    css: {
      color: theme('colors.ochre.100'),
      // ... explicit style rules
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Hugo Build Stats

Added `writeStats = true` to hugo.toml to generate hugo_stats.json, which
Tailwind uses to detect classes in templates.

### 3. Validation System

Created `scripts/check-prose-invert.js` that:

- Verifies presence of critical prose-invert styles
- Checks for proper dark mode variant
- Validates element-specific styles (headings, links, code)
- Integrated into build process to prevent regression

## Current Verification Results

- ✅ 52+ prose-invert occurrences in compiled CSS
- ✅ Dark mode variant `.dark\\:prose-invert` present
- ✅ All critical element styles included
- ✅ Custom ochre color palette properly applied

## Files Modified

1. `tailwind.config.js` - Fixed typography variant structure
2. `hugo.toml` - Added build stats generation
3. `package.json` - Added check-prose script to build process
4. `scripts/check-prose-invert.js` - New validation script
5. `themes/taskusanakirja-theme/assets/css/main.css` - Updated prose-invert
   variant

## Testing Dark Mode

To test dark mode typography:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Visit any content page with prose content
3. Toggle system dark mode or use browser dev tools
4. Text should change to ochre-100 (#f7f0e3) in dark mode

## Potential Future Improvements

1. The test-dark-mode page was created during debugging - consider whether to
   keep it
2. Could add visual regression tests for dark mode
3. Consider adding more granular color checks in the validation script

## Build Process

The prose-invert check is now part of the standard build:

```bash
npm run build  # Runs: build-css → check-prose → hugo --minify
```

If prose-invert styles are missing, the build will fail with clear error
messages.
